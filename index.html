    <h1>My Favourite Things</h1>
    <h2>Track and Field</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My favourite sport to do is track. I started properly playing this sport
      in grade 5 and quickly became very fast and passionate. The races I do are
      the:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>100m</li>
      <li>200m</li>
      <li>400m</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I love playing video games in my free time. I play with my friends and
      enjoy playing a wide variety of video games genres. I primarily play on PC
      and can often find myself getting carried away and wasting a lot of time
      playing video game (I spent a lot of my time before this project
      procrastinating and playing video games). Some of my favourite games are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fortnite</li>
      <li>CS:GO</li>
      <li>Minecraft</li>
      <li>CoC</li>
      <li>Chess</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Working Out</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I enjoy working out because it helps keep me healthy and can even help
      with my other passion, Track and Field. I usually workout with my friends
      and do it both at home and at the gym.
